          <h4>PROGRAM PROFILE</h4>
          <p>
            The Department of Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies
            (BSES) offers a 4-year BS Biology degree program with two major
            fields of specialization to choose from, Ecology and Cell Biology.
            Areas of study in Ecology include life forms in terrestrial and
            aquatic ecosystems. The Cell Biology division has recently been
            expanded to include not only studies of life forms at cellular
            level, but also molecular studies of plant, animal and microbial
            life forms. <br /><br />
            The BS Biology curriculum also includes the conduct of an
            undergraduate thesis which provides the students the opportunity to
            perform research work along their chosen field of specialization
            under the guidance of their selected faculty adviser.
          </p>

          <h4>JOB OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
          <p>
            Students may proceed to pursue a medical degree after graduation.
            Other graduates may pursue careers in either government and private
            institutions as teachers or researchers, or in government
            organizations engaged in biological conservation and/or advocacy
            activities.

        <h1 class="title">Master in Management</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Today’s world of work is more complex and volatile than it was years
            back. Managerial problems, especially those faced by decision-makers
            at the highest levels of administration, have become less structured
            than they were in the past. Increasingly, managers have to deal with
            more sophisticated technologies, more rapidly expanding and
            contracting markets. In adapting to these changes, organizations
            have become flatter, smaller and more flexible in structure, more
            integrative in approach to decision-making, and more global in
            operation. <br /><br />

            Given the dynamism of our present work environment, it becomes
            imperative for organizational leaders to develop the capability to
            assess a broad spectrum of interrelated issues and to interpret a
            continuous stream of data that are vital to decision-making.<br /><br />

            Decision-makers ought to be humanistic because people are the
            carriers of today’s most important resources (knowledge and
            information), and holistic because managerial problems and issues
            are interrelated. <br /><br />

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Integrative Skills</b> - ability to perceive the whole picture

            <li>
              <b>Innovativeness</b> - ability to develop approaches in applying

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Proactiveness</b> - the ability to anticipate problems and
              issues to set the tone for change and develop orientation or
              concern for the enhancement of the human condition in the long
              run.
